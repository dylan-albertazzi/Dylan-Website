Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about my time in Cornwall with Annie's friends.

I ended up in Cornwall because of Annie. She had taken a wild trip where she met a group of guys (one of them being Steve) in Ireland and ended up traveling back with them to their home in Cornwall. She lived there for some time and set up for Steve to house and show me around for a couple of days.

Steve was kind enough to give me the full-on Cornwall experience. From biking along the coastline to going out on his parent's sailboat to eating their traditional foods (Cornish pasties, and biscuits with jelly & clotted cream, on top of course). Steve even sent me and Megs a Christmas card the following year.

Steve shared stories of whole picnics being pillaged in seconds. I experienced their audacity first hand when they made passes at my fish and chips on the water.
