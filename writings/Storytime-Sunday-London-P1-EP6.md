Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about meeting LondonJohn in the tube.

I had a 26 hr stay in London before taking a train to see Annie's friends in Cornwall. I had no idea how the tube worked and ended up getting some tips from London John (@LondonJohn69). He thought my travels were cool and wanted to meet up on my way out a couple of weeks later. It didn't end up working because I was leaving out of Luton which was about an hour away. I still have our email thread from the couple of days after we met.

When I met London John it was probably about midnight, my plane landed at 10:20. I was making my way to a hostel I'd booked somewhere in London and he was heading home from work. About 20 minutes and one switch into our ride the train we were on got shut down because someone had gotten run over by a train that was along our route. We were sitting for about 30 minutes before getting transferred to another train. If I were on my own I don't know what I would've done, but it just so happened that John and I were taking similar routes. He took me through some shortcuts and we ended up getting to our destination within the hour. By then it was almost 2 AM and he sent me on my way with his email and a bottle of water, which I desperately needed.

I proceeded to walk about a mile through a rougher part of London to get to the cheapest hostel I could find (~\$12 per night). The photo says it should've taken 5 min so I must've taken the scenic route. The hostel was the only one I stayed at with triple-decker bunk beds. The small room slept 18. I crawled my way up to the last open bunk in the back of the room and slept with my clothes on that night.

The next morning I had to catch a train to see Annies friends at 11 AM and had until then to see as much of London as I could. The photos below are my morning adventures and above are from the night in the tube. I wish I had more pics of that night in the tube because those are the ones I remember so vividly in my head.
