Over the last few months I have been building Pinterlist, my first web app. My goal, going from content to creation. A few months ago I was sitting there thinking, I am about to graduate college, I study computer science, and I have nothing to show for it. No way to show the world that I actually did learn some stuff in my time at college. It was that moment where I realized that it didn't matter how many courses I had done, or tutorials I had watched. If I didn't have anything to show for it, it was all in vain. The reason I learned to code was to create but somewhere along the way I got caught in the weeds telling my self, just one more tutorial series, then I can do something cool.

4 months later I am deploying a functioning web application to the world. Trust me, I know it has a long ways to go, give me some grace there. I am proud of where it was and what it's become. If you have  any feedback (positive or negative) please don't hesitate to let me know throught text, email, twitter, etc. ðŸ¥³
