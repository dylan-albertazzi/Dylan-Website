Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about the night I flew into Morocco and will never forget.

Morocco was the whole reason my trip got planned in the first place. My buddy Wyatt, who I led YoungLife and lived at VH with invited me to go on a big trip with him to visit his brother in Morocco and some other countries. Because I was taking my boys to YoungLife camp (different crew) we were only going to meet up for a couple of countries. But, because of some miscommunication in planning, we never ended up seeing each other.

I flew into Morocco at 8:35 PM and was expecting to be picked up by Wyatt's brother Mason. However, due to the same miscommunication Mason couldn't make the 3hr round trip to come get me from Rabat and take me to his house in Casablanca. We decided that I would take the train to a Casablanca and he would pick me up from there. However, when I got to the train station and after 45 min figuring out what train to get on (it's not easy when everything is in Arabic) I missed the last train of the night by half an hour. Plan C, book a hostel. Mason sent me the link of a hostel to book and he would come and give me his car in the morning when he left for France. Great.

Well, not so great. I took a screenshot of my hostel reservation (no cell service) and headed outside to find a taxi. I walked up to the driver, showed him my phone, and was met with an expression of confusion, some words in Arabic that I'm guessing meant "I don't know that place", and was promptly shoed away. I repeated this two more times and was met with similar responses. At that point I was confused, maybe I wasn't showing them the right address? So I walked back to the steps of the train station where I was in range of wifi to do more research. Shortly after I sat down on the steps, the first taxi driver whistled me over and pointed me at a taxi I hadn't approached yet. I nodded gratefully and made my way over to the new driver. I was met with a smile and something nice in Arabic that I was guessing meant "I know where to take you, get in!". I hopped in the car and tried to show him my phone with the address but he pushed it away, just giving me reassuring nods that he knew where he was going.

At this point a was getting a pit in my stomach. If I got lost in Morocco for the night it wasn't going to be fun. We were already far enough from the train station and the only known wifi, I was lost as soon as I stepped outside. As the ride went on I did my best to make cross-lingual small talk and show him my phone so he knew where we were going. He engaged in the "small talk" but was never interested in my phone.

All of a sudden we took a turn into an alleyway and started weaving through the back roads of Rabat. No lights, no sense of direction, 12:30 at night, and I wasn't sure that a hostel would be waiting for me on the other side.

After a couple of minutes, the driver stopped at the corner with a lady waiting outside. Heart pounding, I reluctantly got out and followed her. This wasn't a hostel. What hostel is an 8 story building with no signs, not connected to any main roads, and with no lights on? With little option, I did my best not to show my fear and followed the lady in. She opened the door to the building that looked like a hotel. Straight ahead, there was an elevator lit by a single light and dark hallways running down either side. We walked in and she clicked the elevator button.

... To be continued next Storytime Sunday!
