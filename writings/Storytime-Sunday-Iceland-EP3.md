Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about my rocky start and adventures with my newly found Canadian friend, Steven.

I threw up in a Subway as soon as I made it to Reyjavik. I was already feeling queazy from the flight into Iceland and then had to take a curvy 45-minute van ride to the hostel with a man who took no interest in accelerating smoothly. By the end, it was taking everything in me to not to keep my insides in me and not the van. As soon as we stopped I sprinted to the first bathroom I could find. Which turned out to be Subway, who oddly had locations around Iceland like McDonald's has in the US.

What a way to start the trip. I was drained and on the verge of tears after almost two days straight of travel, not eating a full meal in at least 12 hours, and not knowing where I was. That was the lowest moment of the trip and thanks to some encouraging words from Megs, we pushed forward.

> I met Steven in the hostel the night I got in. He was my same age (20), from Montreal Canada, and was celebrating his college graduation by taking his first-ever solo trip.

I was just planning on walking around Reykjavik for the couple days I was in Iceland because a car rental was over \$100 per day. Steven and I ended up hitting it off at dinner and he invited me to come adventure with him IN HIS CAR the next day. It turned out to be one of the most epic days of my life. Not only did we tour Iceland's iconic Golden Circle for 16 straight hours, it was also light all day because it was the Summer Solstice. It was 10:30 PM before we realized it was dinner time!

All of the Iceland photos were taken that day.
