GrubGuide is a tool I built that provides business intelligence for Bend's local restaurants.

GrubGuide provides intelligence through collecting the preferences of our restaurantâ€™s actual customers.
It also serves Bend's tourists by providing delightful, fast, and accurate restaurant suggestions to improve their experience in Bend.

I give a demo and go into more detail in the video below ðŸ‘‡
