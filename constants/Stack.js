        "In order to clearly show the results of the labâ€™s research paper to RSS we needed a way to visualize the data we collected. <br> I wrote a script that converts a file with all of the motor and joint positions of the robot during a run to the visualization you see on the left. This involved mapping the motor and joint positions to an object that could be sent into the MuJoCo visualization simulator. <br>This allowed our team to not only tell but clearly show the results we produced.",
