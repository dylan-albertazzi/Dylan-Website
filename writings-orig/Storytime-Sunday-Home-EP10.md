Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about my last stop of the journey.

I got to spend one more day in Iceland because of a 26-hour layover on my way back home. I stayed in Keflavik where the airport is, instead of Reykjavik, the capital of the country where I stayed on my way in. I spent the day exploring Keflavik by bus and foot. Somehow or another I ended up by the water where a group of people were fishing. It seemed like every 30 seconds someone was pulling up a fish. Each group had a bucket like the ones you get from home depot and was filling it. The abundance was incredible.
