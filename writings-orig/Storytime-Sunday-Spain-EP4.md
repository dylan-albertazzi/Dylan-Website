Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about hanging with Linday on his home turf of Barcelona.

I ended up in Barcelona to visit my close friend Lindsay. His family moved over our Sophomore year of high school and he ended up staying through college. It was really cool to see him after so long and to see him operating so confidently in such a large city.

The first night he took me to a bar with a view of the Barcelona skyline. We caught up, laughed, admired the views.

He introduced me to his Russian friend Andrey and we watched the Spain Russia World Cup Game together. Lindsay and Andrey rooted for Russia which pissed off the rest of the cafe we were in.

One memory I will never forget is walking by the FC Barcelona Stadium at around 1AM. There were prostitutes on every corner. Sitting there lifeless, most of looking at their phones with a gaunt expression. It was heartbreaking to see and to realize how present evil is in the world. Right under my nose, in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, these women were living in chains. I never got to hear any of their stories but I think of them often.

Lindsay also took me to dinner at his (at the time) girlfriend Silvia's house. Her parents spoke no English and it was fun trying to share stories with them and pull out some of the little Spanish that stuck with me through high school.
