Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is about a town that seemed to be separate from the rest of the world.

I've dubbed Luton the Twilight Zone. I arrived at 10:15 AM and had a 20 hour layover before my 6 AM flight the next morning. I booked an AirBnb and could check in when my host got home from work at 5:30. With some time to kill I took the bus to the mall and made my way in and out of almost every store striking up conversations with the workers. Every single person I talked to was having a bad day. And when I looked around everyone did seem sad.

After a couple hours in the mall I made my way to a bowling alley to get some frames in. While I was playing a man came up to me, either on drugs or with a mental disability, very keen to strike up a conversation. I was happy to oblige as I didn't have many people to talk to. It started getting weird though when he asked for my phone number. I told him that my phone didn't work in the UK and that it wouldn't be of any use. He asked a few more times and then asked to bowl a frame, which I let him do, then went on his way.

After I finished two games of bowling I went to see what else I could do for fun in Luton. As I was walking out of the bowling alley I heard two women fighting. They seemed about my age and it sounded like one owed money to the other. What hit me was the level of seriousness and desperation in their voices.

    "B\*\_!? next time I see you, you better have my money or I'll stab you!"

    "B!\_? I don't owe you anything, F\*!> you!"

That went on for another minute before the girl who owed the money punched the other one in the face and started yanking her hair. I was standing 20 ft. away jaw dropped at what I was watching. All of a sudden a security guard popped out, broke them up, and they went on their way.

I went to Starbucks to use their wifi and charge my phone. I was sitting there listening to a meeting at the table next to me where this guy was trying to get a lady to buy into a network marketing scheme promising her the opportunity to make lots of money if she joined. To my surprise, the guy from the bowling alley who wanted my phone number walked into Starbucks. A mile and a half away, what are the odds? He came and asked for my phone number again, and I re-explained how it wouldn't work. He got the picture and struck a conversation with someone else, probably asking for their phone number. Eventually, I made my way to the Airbnb and stayed with the first friendly people I'd met all day.

I left the Airbnb at 3:00 AM in order to catch a bus to get to my 6:00 AM flight out of Luton. I opened the door to a dark morning wearing my alpargatas and striped shirt that Lindsay gave me (I didn't look intimidating, alpargatas are a traditional Spanish shoe and are basically Tom's). I took a right and walked out of the neighborhood to a T in the street. At the T you could see a straight shot to the bus stop about 300 yards away. As I took a left towards the bus stop I surveyed the scene. It was dark, lit by a street lamp at the corner of each block. There were no cars, no wind, and the stars were out. A couple of blocks ahead of me and on the same side of the street, a lady was pacing up and back one of the blocks. A couple of blocks after her were two men standing in silence by a trash can smoking cigarettes. Then a few blocks further a man was sitting in the middle of the road on the other side of the street on a BMX bike.

As soon as I turned onto the street they all turned to look at me as I approached. I walked by the lady, wondering why she was out so late, I had some ideas but wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. I said,

    "Hi, how are you?"

    "Good, are you looking for some fun?"

I was half expecting that response but it still threw me off and I said "cool" in a voice that sounded like a voice crack from puberty.

Next, I walked by the men by the trashcan and gave a small head nod of acknowledgment. They just stared at me with their cigarettes as I passed. I looked back once a got a block away and they were both just standing there.

A couple of blocks further I started to approach the guy on the BMX bike. I was facing forwards towards the bus station and he was sitting to my right on the other side of the street, facing me. As I started to cross he started riding his bike slowly towards me. I said with as much confidence as I could muster,

    "Hey man, how's it going?"

    "I'm good, do you have ï¿¡20 I can borrow?"

    "No, sorry man, I'm just here on a layover and just have a card."

    "That's okay, there's an ATM up the road.", he said with persistence.

    "Sorry man, it won't work here, I don't have ï¿¡20 for you."

    "No really, it's okay, there's an ATM up the road we can go to.", with even more persistence.

    "I really wish I could help you but I don't have ï¿¡20 for you."

Without a word he turned around and went back to his spot. I picked up my pace without making it look like I was in a hurry and made it the rest of the way to the bus stop.

I sat on the bench and looked to my right. It was like the level of a video game had reset. The lady was pacing on the block, the men were smoking around the garbage can, and the guy was sitting in the same spot on his bike. I felt safe sitting at the bus stop 50 yards away, not because a was out of the situation but because they had almost acknowledged that I "passed" the level and they weren't going to give me any trouble.

15 minutes later the bus came and I left the Twilight Zone.
