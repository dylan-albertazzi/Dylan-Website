My last night in Cypress I stayed in Larnaca close to the airport. I booked a room at a place that was half hotel half hostel. You got a room to share with one other person. Which is a terrible setup in my opinion. In a hostel there are 5-10 people in the room and you can count on most of them being good. If you get a bad apple in a one on one room with a lock there's no one to help. I made it to the hotel-hostel around 10:30 PM and was told I might be having someone join me in the room later.

My flight out of Cypress was at 7:10AM and the innkeeper told me that taxi's didn't operate when I needed a ride at 4AM. I would have to reserve one for over \$100 which was more than I had to spend. The airport was 3.5 miles away and he suggested I walk, so I did.

That night I would wake up every half hour or so because I was paranoid about who my roommate could be and slept with my clothes on and bag packed until I needed to head out at 3AM. No one ever ended up sharing the room with me.

It was about 72 degrees with a light breeze and dark when I set out for the airport. There were so many stray cats. It felt like every block I turned onto there was another one walking in the street. I thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous sunrise. I must've been enjoying it too much because I ended up getting behind schedule and had to run the last mile to the airport.

Once I got there was some confusion with my plane ticket. I had accidentally scheduled it for the next day which would totally throw off the rest of the flights on my schedule. After some time with an airport attendant we figured out that I had also booked a flight for today and that I accidentally bought an extra ticket. I made it through just in time and was on my way to a daylong layover in London, then home!
