We got in, me first then her. The elevator was small, and we were crammed in because of my backpack. She hit the 7th floor and we started moving up. "Okay, 7th floor. That's where I'm at if I need to make an escape." There was a "ding" and the doors opened onto another set of unlit hallways stretching down on either side far enough that I couldn't make out the doors on the end. "Get out, get out" the lady said in a nice voice. I think she could tell I was reluctant. The whole time I was asking her if this was a hostel, and she was telling me yes. I didn't believe her but I was in this far. I was just praying that I would make it out. She led me to the very last door in the hallway and got out a set of keys to unlock the door. She slowly opened it to another dark room where all I could make out was a coffee table with a whiskey decanter sitting on it and a couple of headshots of men with some big beards and turbans. Someone was in the other room watching tv and another in the kitchen making something. And with a deep breath, half bracing for impact and half ready to scream, in I went.

"That will be 57 Dirhams." Wait how does she know how much I paid for the hostel? That was the moment I realized that this was legit. After a couple of minutes of broken discourse, I pulled out of her that this was her house and she was AirBnbing out the extra room. Boy was that a relief. She gave me a towel to shower and was incredibly hospitable. Still shell shocked from the whole experience, I slept with my clothes on, bag packed, and was out before anyone was awake.

In hindsight, I was safe the whole time but the moment was one of the scariest things I've been through.

Contrary to my perceptions the first night, the people of Morocco were some of the most friendly and hospitable of the whole trip. I'll share the stories of Mohssin, Mason's friend, and how he showed up to the house every day to hang out with me.

The night before at the "hostel" was enough adventure for the whole trip, little did I know there was one waiting for me the next morning. As I said above, me and Wyatt had miscommunicated on the dates we would each be in Morocco. We thought that we would meet up in Morocco for a few days then go explore Cypress together all the while being guided by Mason, Wyatt's brother. What actually ended up happening was I missed Wyatt all together and the day after I flew into Morocco Mason was heading to France.

Because Mason was heading to the airport in Rabat (where I spent the night), we decided that we would meet at the airport and he would give me his car to take back to his house in Casablanca. He showed up later that morning, we talked for a bit, then he asked me if I could drive stick. I had driven stick once in middle school. Mason gave me a crash course in a dirt parking lot outside of the airport and sent me on the 45 min ride back to Casablanca.

The route was mostly highway with a small town at the end. Normally this wouldn't have been a big deal because I could get up to gear and not worry about shifting. But it wasn't that simple because of the toll booths posted every few miles on the highway. Every five-ten minutes I would lurch into a toll booth, drop in change Mason left for me in the console, and make the difficult shift into first gear (which I never got the hang of). The stressful part about that was actually less that I was killing a car, which I did feel bad about, and more that I was driving without a license and there was military posted periodically along the road. After hearing stories from Lindsay getting pulled over when he was in Morocco with his buddies, I didn't want to share the experience.

As I pulled into Casablanca the flow of traffic picked up and turned from an orderly line to something more akin to a school of fish. The lines were no longer relevant, people just drove where there was space, and the mopeds wove through the gaps. Every time I got to a roundabout I would end up having to stop and killing the car trying to go again. Seriously, every roundabout I killed and had 20 Moroccans honking their horns at me in unison. One roundabout actually killed it twice in a row and had more like 40 honking at me. But for them a honk doesn't have a malicious stigma like it does in the Northwest, it's more like New York where people will honk just to let you know where they are. By the grace of God I made it to Mason's house in Casablanca, hungry, and ready for a nap.

The day after my first night at Mason's house there was a knock on the door and a man standing there. I wasn't expecting visitors and was startled when he didn't go away. Eventually, I answered and learned that the man standing there was Mohssin, one of Mason's friends. He spoke little English but was eager to talk and learn about me. Over the next few days with Google Translate and his moped, he showed me his home of Morocco. He took me to the beach, the Morocco Mall, and even invited me over for dinner at his house with his family. It was incredible seeing how he lived. He still reaches out from time to time over Facebook Messenger.

Wyatt encouraged me to go adventure in the town of Casablanca. Mason's house was technically on Jack's Beach which is a 15 minute taxi ride outside of the city. I hailed a taxi and we took the short ride to Casablanca, stopping at Africa's larges mosque along the way. I quickly learned how cheap everything was in Morocco. I got large meal of fish and olives for a few bucks and a 45 minute taxi ride from earlier was about $15. The taxi ride this morning wasn't the case. As we ended our 15 minute taxi ride the driver said that it would be the equivalent of $80 for the ride. He must've saw I was a visitor and was doing his best to see what he could squeeze out of me. I told him no, and that his price was ridiculous. He didn't speak English so we went back and forth the best we could. He even pulled out a white board and was drawing out the $80 I "owed" him. Once I realized we weren't getting anywhere I pulled out about $15 and handed it out to him. He acted disgusted and raised his voice at first but after a minute of me insisting that this was generous he finally took it and went on his way.

The funny thing is that this taxi driver turned out to be the only one who took people from Jack's Beach to Casablanca and I needed him to get back to the airport on my way home. He pulled up smiling like we were best friends and waved me in with a smile. There were absolutely no hard feelings from our episode a few days before. And I was fine with that. We actually ended up laughing together and really enjoying our ride to the air port. This time the price of the ride was decided on beforehand of course.
