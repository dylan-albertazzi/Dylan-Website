Tonight, day 12 of the George Floyd protests, is the first time I've internalized the very real difference of my life vs. someone of color. As I was watching videos of the protests it hit me like a ton of bricks that in all of our relationships we bring a lifetime of baggage that others don't see. But the more we get to know people, the more we see behind the curtain and the closer we become. Tonight for me, was the first time I truly peeked behind the curtain of the pain people of color face on a daily basis.

I didn't, and will never fully, understand the struggles people of color face everyday. Struggles like having to worry for your life when you get pulled over for speeding. Worrying about being mistaken as a burglar for wearing a hoodie on a jog through your neighborhood. The incessant and underlying current of fear and frustration that comes from dealing with a lifetime of racism.

> While I'll never fully understand, I'm doing my best to. Today was the first time I had a visceral reaction to the oppression that people of color face in my own backyard. And it is heart breaking.

I want to make it clear to my community, especially my friends of color, that I am anti-racist. My heart hurts with you for the pain you have felt. And my heart is overjoyed with the change and awareness the last few weeks have brought and will continue to bring.
