Re-living the stories from my solo trip tracing from Iceland to Morocco the Summer of 2018.

This Sunday is a quick one about a lesson I learned about street vendors the hard way.

One of the souvenirs I took from Rome, besides a sweet sandal tan, was a rasta bracelet that was skillfully sold to me by a street vendor. I had two full days in Rome and each was jam-packed with sightseeing and experiencing the rich history. On the second day, I was adventuring through ancient Rome and was approached by a friendly African man offering to give me a bracelet for free. Knowing that it wasn't going to be free I politely declined. But he insisted the bracelet was free and asked if I had any women in my life back home who I could give it to. I said sure and he put the bracelet on my wrist. I said thank you and went on my way. I made it about 10 steps when he said. "Wait one more thing! The bracelet is free but I'm a single dad raising my beautiful baby daughter. I don't have much money, could you give me a couple of dollars for her?" He showed me a picture of her on his phone. I don't know if he actually had a daughter or he was playing me but I obliged and gave him a few bucks. From then on out I gave all other eager vendors a hard no.

I also got to go to a mass in the Vatican!
